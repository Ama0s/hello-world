A home for data sets and engaging visualizations that illuminate the experiences of end users of our social welfare system, across a variety of issue areas.
Hello World! It's Ama0s! I'm a Canadian working to collect qualitative data, using ethnographic methods, about how people access resources (or don't) to address life's various challenges, with the aim of redesigning our stickiest social safety systems. I want to use GitHub to pair qualitative data with quantitative data and present it in a way that can generate more powerful insights about the future of social supports.
